/*
We're going to write a function that checks if a number is bigger than 100.

create a function that has one parameter (argument)
think of good names for the function and the parameter
inside the function check the number
if the number is bigger than 100 use the return keyword to return true
if the number is 100 or smaller use the return keyword to return false
now we're going to check if the function works as we intended
call the function with different numbers
use console.log to display the return value of the function
the end result of this exercise should not use console.log inside of the function
Now think about the categories of functions we discussed: functions that do something and functions that produce something. What kind of function is this?
